# WekaLib

Is a wrapper around the Weka libraries.

Enables access to the Weka functionalities without explicitly importing the weka libraries inside a project. May be useful to resolve Weka import conflicts with the module-versions of Java.

Requires:

1) library weka-stable-3.8.2.jar

2) library simpleeducationallearningschemes-1.0.2.jar
 - for the Prism classifier;

3) Many other Weka libraries to actually run the Weka code
